# CalTracker


My first React.js Project. Just wanted to see what it's like building  the front-end. Reason for this project is because someone like me it's hard to gain weight, since my Metabolism is fast. And the only way for me to gain weight is to eat more food. Which means that I need to start tracking my Calorie intake. This is a side project, and I tried to make it a little fun for me.

This is what the UI looks like.
